# Week4
## Getting started
This project focuses on the application of unsupervised learning techniques to classify Sentinel-3 altimetry echoes in the Arctic region. The primary objective is to differentiate between Sea Ice and Leads (narrow channels of open water) based on their unique radar backscatter signatures. We will cover K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) clustering.
